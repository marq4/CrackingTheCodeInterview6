# CrackingTheCodeInterview6

## Python: ##
* (Almost) no solutions here, just skeleton code and tests. 
* Quickly implement and verify your solutions to the book problems. 
* Forget about boilerplate code.  
* Just get pytest (in Win with Git Bash): pip install -U pytest 
* Instructions at the top of every file. 
* Please note that this code is considered good to pylint so please lint your code before sending pull requests. 

## Java: ##
* My solutions to the Cracking The Coding Interview book problems, 6th edition. 
* Please note that I like to captitalize everything that is not a primitive (Strings, ObjectInstances, Integers). 
* Please let me know if you find any bugs. I appreciate any feedback including optimizations and suggestions.
